# Plotly_Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Overview
This project is to create panel for demographic information and to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer.The volunteers will be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons which might be used to manufacture the synthetic beef.

## Website
Interactive Webpage can be found here: [GitHub Pages](https://ashwinihegde28.github.io/Plotly_Belly_Button_Biodiversity/) 


### Brief Summary of Steps involved:

1. Used D3.json() to fetch external data from json file, web APIs and to store the selected option from the user.
3. Parse data in JSON format.
4. Use functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.
5. Use event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization.
6. Create basic plots with Plotly, including bar charts, line charts, and gauge charts.
8. Deploy an interactive chart to GitHub Pages.

### Deliverable 1:
To create a Horizontal Bar Chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage using the knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly and D3.js.The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.
- The Bar Chart looks like below <br>

### Deliverable 2:
To create a Bubble Chart using the knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly and D3.js, that displays the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:

1) The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
2) The sample_values as the y-axis values.
3) The sample_values as the marker size.
4) The otu_ids as the marker colors.
5)The otu_labels as the hover-text values.
- Bubble chart looks like the following image: <br>

### Deliverable 3: 
To create a Gauge Chart using the knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly and D3.js which visualizes the users about the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
-  Gauge chart looks similar to the following image: <br>
